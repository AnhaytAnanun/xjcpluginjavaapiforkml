# XJC Plugin to generate the Java API for KML
The Java API for KML (JAK) is automatically generated by OGC’s KML schema specification file ogckml22.xsd and Google’s Gx extensions file kml22gx.xsd. Every time the KML schema evolves, an build cycle is initiated and JAK reflects all changes automatically.

The high level documentation found at Micromata Labs Implementation explains what it takes to create the Java API for KML. It is not essential in understanding the usage of the Java API for KML. The build cycle is explained and the implementation details are shown. Every time the KML schema evolves, the build cycle is initiated and JAK reflects all changes automatically. It is about the implementation details, why things were done as they are, and how this JAXB plugin does all the automatic API creation.

The Java API for KML can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/javaapiforkml
